# üìà US Inflation Rate Prediction using ARIMA Model

## üîç Overview
This project aims to predict the US inflation rate using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The dataset consists of historical inflation rate data, and the model is built to forecast future inflation trends.

- CONSUMER CONF INDEX = Consumer Confidence Index provided by Conference Board
- PPI-CONST MAT = Producers Purchase Index- Construction Materials
- CPIALLITEMS = Consumer Price Index- All Items for the US
- INFLATION(%) = Inflation rate in the US
- MORTGAGE INT. MONTHLY AVG(%) = Average Mortgage interest rate of all Weeks of a particular month
- MED HOUSEHOLD INCOME = Median Household Income in the US
- CORP. BOND YIELD(%)
- MONTHLY HOME SUPPLY
- % SHARE OF WORKING POPULATION = Share of Population between the age 18 and 60
- GDP PER CAPITA
- QUARTERLY REAL GDP
- QUARTERLY GDP GROWTH RATE (%)
- CSUSHPISA = S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index given by FRED

## üèóÔ∏è Model Development

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing: Load and clean historical inflation data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends and check stationarity.
3. Model Selection: Use ACF/PACF plots to determine ARIMA parameters.
4. Model Training & Tuning: Fit the ARIMA model and optimize parameters.
5. Forecasting: Predict future inflation rates and evaluate performance.

## üìä Results
1. Visual representation of past and predicted inflation rates.
2. Model evaluation metrics, achieving R¬≤ = 0.973, MAE = 0.249, MSE = 0.112, and RMSE = 0.335.
