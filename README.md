# üìà Inflation Rate Prediction in US

## üîç Overview
This study will focus on analysis of inflation rate in the US during 2002-2022 to understand how macroeconomic factors affect to the inflation in the US.

The data visualisation using some package such as matplot, seaborn, and plotly, will be use to visually analyse the relationship between inflation rate and macroeconomic features. This will provide insight details for making business and monetary policy decisions.

An ARIMA model has been selected for the machine learning approach.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Development

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing: Load and clean historical inflation data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends and check stationarity.
3. Model Selection: Use ACF/PACF plots to determine ARIMA parameters.
4. Model Training & Tuning: Fit the ARIMA model and optimize parameters.
5. Forecasting: Predict future inflation rates and evaluate performance.

## üìä Results
1. Visual representation of past and predicted inflation rates.
2. Model evaluation metrics, achieving R¬≤ = 0.973, MAE = 0.249, MSE = 0.112, and RMSE = 0.335.
